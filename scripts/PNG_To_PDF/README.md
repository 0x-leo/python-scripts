This script consist of python code which converts PNG to PDF.

It has a PNG image to use as example. For different image just write url of different image which you want to use/ replace "image.png" with total url of the image file.

Write the location of the PDF to be saved at/ replace 'document.pdf' with the total url and name of pdf along with pdf extension.

I have used flake8 linting on this as well.

Dependency: Download python and write "pip install Pillow" in cmd.
