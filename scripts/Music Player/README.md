# Music Player GUI

This is a GUI framework where two GUI libraries are used:

- Pygame
- Tkinter

It has functions such as play, stop, pause and resume in order to control the music player.

To create a music player with Python, we will be using the **Pygame** sound component and _askdirectory()_ method of Tkinter
