# RSA ENCRYPTION ALGO IMPLEMENTATION IN PYTHON

-I've imported the rsa package.
-It generates the public and private key. 
-It then stores the keys in keys/privkey.pem and keys/publickey.pem.
-The keys are then loaded to the program as publickey and privatekey. 
-The inputed text or message is encrypted with the public key.
-Which then is put in the variable ciphertext. 
-The private key is used to decrypt the message. 
-Here we also verify the signature of the message and the keys, whether they are signified or not.
